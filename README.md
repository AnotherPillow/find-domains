# Find Domains

A basic program to find domains to buy.

## Usage

1. Download the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the program with `py main.py`

## Notes

- Namecheap prices are based on a random domain and may not be accurate for your domain.

## Debug Mode

If you run using `--debug`, it will log all data to `debug.json` (price, domain, data, timestamp, source)
